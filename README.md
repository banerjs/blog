# Blog

All of us have this innate desire to spout words onto paper. Someday, I will too. For now, I'm using this as an excuse to learn cool new technologies.

- Django & JQuery: DONE. Easy and quick to setup - the previous version of my website was running this code. Learned how to parse markdown into HTML in real time within a form. But I wanted more of a challenge; I wanted to learn something completely new. Not using it anymore, and I don't think this code is available anywhere anymore.

- Undertow and JQuery: DONE. Things were speedy, but the amount of setup time required was prohibitive. Only conducted local tests of this setup and the code is no longer available anywhere

- Node and React: IN PROGRESS. Definitely more complex than a simple blog needs to be. However, I am learning someethings about JS. Might stand me well in the long run.
