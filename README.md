All of us have this innate desire to spout words onto paper. Someday, I will too. For now, I'm using this as an excuse to learn cool new technologies.

- Django & JQuery: DONE. Running on current version of [My Website](http://www.banerjs.com/). To play around with the internals of that website [Contact Me](banerjs.sid@banerjs.com)

- Undertow and JQuery: DONE. Things were speedy, but the amount of setup time required was prohibitive. The only place that code is available is on my local laptop.

- Node and React: IN PROGRESS. Everyone is going gaga about React (my own [workplace](https://www.redfin.com/) has decided to adopt it). Hence the current project. I can safely say that this project has had me *futz-ing* with JS, HTML, and CSS to a degree that I have never had to before. Let's see how this goes.
