# To start

- Start from Windows: `docker-machine.exe env --shell powershell default | Invoke-Expression`
- Start a new web container with the following command: `docker run --name blog -i -t -v /c/Users/Siddhartha/Documents/Code/blog/:/usr/src/ -w /usr/src/ -p 8000:8000 --rm node:4 bash`
  - Note that problems with browserify and ejsify for auth0 means that we have to use node 4.x
  - If this is the first time running the container, then make sure to export .env in the current directory. It sets up the required environment variables locally
- Start a new postgres container `docker run --name blog-pg -d -v /tmp/blog/:/var/lib/postgresql/data -P -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=a postgres`
  - Note the container uses the folder /tmp in the virtual machine as a data directory. This is not accessible from windows
  - Use `docker network inspect bridge` to figure out the IP address of the new container
  - Run `export DATABASE_URL="<postgres url of database>"` in the node container shell running the server
- Start a new redis container `docker run --name blog-redis -d -P redis`
  - Note that we do not want persistent storage on redis; at least not yet
  - Use `docker network inspect bridge` to figure out the IP address of the new container
  - Run `export REDIS_URL="<redis url of the database>"` in the node container shell running the server
- Run the npm installer to get all project dependencies: `./install_deps_globally.sh package.json`
- Clean and start gulp in watch mode: `npm run clean; npm run gulp &`
- Start the server in debug: `npm run debug`

The reason I'm not using firebase/mongo are because of pricing, lookup latencies and storage restrictions when deploying on Heroku. On Openshift, this would not be a problem, but the setup there takes longer.
- For posterity's sake, here were a few data sources that I was considering a while back:
  - [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) - Excellent API and libraries
  - [MyJSON](http://myjson.com/) - Free and very easy to use
  - MongoDB - this comes free(ish) with hosting
  - Postgres - harder to model flexible data. But also free-ish
  - Filesystem - cheapest option. Probably not the most performant though
- Free Stock Photos - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Online Image Compression - [CompressJPEG](http://compressjpeg.com/) and [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- Glyphs from [WebHostingHub](http://www.webhostinghub.com/glyphs/)
- [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) is an excellent online image editing platform
- [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io/) seems like a promising place for creating a Flux data flow. [This](https://github.com/yahoo/fluxible/blob/master/docs/blog/2014-11-06-bringing-flux-to-the-server.md) seems like a decent tutorial on using Fluxible

# Features

- Animations
- Migrate to ES6
- Create Unit Tests
- Add in Timeouts to the fetch code on the server side. While Promise.race is a viable option, there already exists express middleware capable of doing this
- Improve Performance
  - Use a proper cache for posts instead of memory
  - Use `bluebird`, or something equally performant, for promises
- Help popup for keyboard shortcuts
- Migrate to OpenShift and scalable infrastructure
- Configure the docker-compose files necessary to start all the different containers at the same time
- Templating of the HTML stored in the posts
  - Design a syntax set that can be used to add automatic metadata to post HTML
- Structure editing similar to Trello
- Better routing in the Admin section, and maybe even the Blog section
  - Routing using constants in the Actions is distressing
  - Django style URLs and URL processing
  - 404 page when browsing client side
  - Graceful handling of trailing slashes

# Todo
