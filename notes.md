# Todo

- Create page design
  - ~~Travelogue Mock~~
  - Skrollr-ize the mocks. Easy addition of skrollr pages
    - Add better animation for country name & image entry (slide 6 in examples)
  - Create mocks for general blog
  - Create Navigation
- Create isomorphic webapp
  - Create modular models. Includes configuring data source(s)
  - Create modular React components
- Wrap style and required scripts together
  - Separate out styles into CSS files, etc.
  - Include ability to require CSS (webpack)

At this point the webapp is deploy worthy. Once this milestone is reached:

- Allow easy SSR
  - Webpack include of scripts and CSS
  - Non-render of Google Maps on the server side (trivial?)
- Use [Mapstraction](http://mapstraction.com/) to ensure agnostic maps
- Edit API/UI
  - Figure out authentication
  - Utilize apps perhaps
- Docker-ize webapp
