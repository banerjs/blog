# Todo

- Create page design
  - ~~Travelogue Mock~~
  - ~~Skrollr-ize the mocks. Easy addition of skrollr pages~~
    - ~~Add better animation for country name & image entry (slide 6 in examples)~~
    - Auto hide and show map when data loads
      - Use Flux pattern
  - Create mocks for general blog
  - Create Navigation
  - Make responsive
- Create isomorphic webapp
  - Create modular models. Includes configuring data source(s)
    - [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) - Excellent API and libraries
    - [MyJSON](http://myjson.com/) - Free and very easy to use
    - MongoDB - this comes free(ish) with hosting
    - Postgres - harder to model flexible data. But also free-ish
    - Filesystem - cheapest option. Probably not the most performant though
  - Create modular React components
    - Build on Flux pattern in page mocks
- Wrap style and required scripts together
  - Separate out styles into CSS files, etc.
  - Include ability to require CSS (webpack)

At this point the webapp is deploy worthy. Once this milestone is reached:

- Allow easy SSR
  - Webpack include of scripts and CSS
  - Non-render of Google Maps on the server side (trivial?)
- Use [Mapstraction](http://mapstraction.com/) to ensure agnostic maps
- Edit API/UI
  - Authentication
  - Utilize apps perhaps
- Docker-ize webapp

# Data Model

	countries: {
		url: {
			name,
			abbr,
			properties,
			geometry (geo),
			has_been_visited,
			posts: [{
				title,
				url,
				date,
				blurb
			}, ...]
		}, ...
	},
	posts: {
		year: {
			month: {
				day: {
					url: {
						title,
						content: [{
							type,
							data,
							properties (obj)
						}, ...],
						locations(?): [{
							name,
							country
						}, ...]
					}, ...
				}, ...
			}, ...
		}, ...
	}
