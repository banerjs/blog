# To start

- startup a new container with the following command: `docker run -i -t -v /c/Users/Siddhartha/Documents/Code/blog/:/usr/src/ -w /usr/src/ -p 8000:8000 --rm node bash`
- Get and start screen: `apt-get update && apt-get install screen dialog` followed by `screen`
- Run the npm installer to get all project dependencies: `. install_deps_globally.sh package.json`
- Clean and start gulp in watch mode: `npm run clean; npm run gulp &`
- Start the server in debug: `npm run debug`

- Tried using [gulp-reacss](https://github.com/yodairish/gulp-reacss). Failed. I believe the API is not fully fleshed out yet. However, it does give me the means of trying to use the [css](https://github.com/reworkcss/css) library should I desire to do so.
- Setting up PG - [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) and [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) alongwith [pg-monitor](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-monitor). The reason I'm not using firebase/mongo are because of pricing, lookup latencies and storage restrictions when deploying on Heroku. On Openshift, this would not be a problem, but the setup there takes longer.
- For posterity's sake, here were a few data sources that I was considering a while back:
  - [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) - Excellent API and libraries
  - [MyJSON](http://myjson.com/) - Free and very easy to use
  - MongoDB - this comes free(ish) with hosting
  - Postgres - harder to model flexible data. But also free-ish
  - Filesystem - cheapest option. Probably not the most performant though

# Feature Requests

- Continuous scrolling of fullpage.js slides (might need to hack internals)
- Switch scroll direction of sections and slides. Again, might require a hack and could be really hard simply because of the way HTML was originally set up to be used as a standard

# Todo

- Create content for the about page

# Data Model

The data model does the following:

- Specify the internal HTML for a section
- Affect the CSS for a section (most notably background colour)
- Send this HTML through AJAX requests
- Differentiate between section and slide

The following JSON is available to the client. Based on the type of query, we can return with the appropriate sections populated.

    [{
      /** section */
      styles,
      slides: [{
        /** slide */
        url (pkey),
        html,
        styles
      }, ...]
    }, ...]

The storage model in the DB however is different. We're using PG (easiest on Heroku) so the following denotes the columns for each row in the DB:

    id(serial)
    url(str)
    section(int)
    slide(int)
    html(str)
    styles(str)
    section_styles(str)
    created(date)
    updated(date)

The constraints on this storage are:

    unique(url)
    unique(section, slide)

Notes on the styles objects:

- The styles parameter is stored as a JSON str in the database. It is a JSON object
- Styling for the slide or section is done with `styles.root`. All other children of the styles object are style objects for the stored html and can be referenced by their `styles.html_tag_name.root`.
- As alluded to earlier, the styles object may be hierarchical in nature
- The section_styles (should there exist any) are copied over multiple rows. This is to save storage space on Heroku.
